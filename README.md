I'm a BSc in Economics from University Torcuato di Tella and a BSc + MSc in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires. My interests currently lie in the intersection between Computer Science and Machine Learning, with applications to Recommender Systems.

I currently work as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, focusing on the checkout process for Business customers. Previously, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer in the Recommender Systems team at MercadoLibre, the largest e-commerce of Latin America.
