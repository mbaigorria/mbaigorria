I'm a BSc in Economics from University Torcuato di Tella and a BSc + MSc in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires. My expertise and interests lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Machine Learning, specifically in the area of Recommender Systems.

Currently, I work as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, where I am focused on enhancing personalization for Alexa's automatic speech recognition system in the entertainment domain. Prior to this role, I held positions as a Software Engineer, where I contributed to improving Amazon's checkout process for business customers, and as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer in the Recommender Systems team at MercadoLibre, the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America.
