I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Meta, where I work on automatic speech recognition (ASR) for Wearables. My background spans over 10 years of industry experience at the intersection of machine learning and software engineering, with a focus on ASR and Recommender Systems. I hold a BSc in Economics from Universidad Torcuato Di Tella and a BSc + MSc in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires.

Previously, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon, enhancing personalization for Alexaâ€™s ASR system in the entertainment domain. I also worked as a Software Engineer on Amazon's B2B checkout experience and as a Senior ML Engineer on the Recommender Systems team at MercadoLibre, Latin America's leading e-commerce platform.
